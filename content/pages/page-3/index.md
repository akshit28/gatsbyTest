## The Spanish and American Connection

Many theorists connect the origin of the game to Spanish communities and believe that early Spanish communities who moved to the West developed it. Such theories are based on the striking resemblance of rummy to the Spanish game of Conquian. Some other theorists say that it originated in America and later it reached Mexico, where it was called Conquian.

## The Poker Theory

Some theorists believe that French settlers in the West developed rummy from poker. The propagators of this theory say that rummy and poker share similar concepts of forming sequences and groups. According to [<u>John Scarne</u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scarne), a famous author on card games, rummy was derived from the card game called Whiskey Poker and was later known as Rum Poker, which was later renamed Rum, and finally called Rummy.

## The Asian Connection

The history of rummy could be traced back to the first game of draw and discard pattern: the Chinese card game of Mah Jong. This game was first developed during the Tang dynasty in China, over 1,000 years ago. Other theories link it to the Japanese game of Hanafuda, which was developed by the Portuguese who travelled to Japan. Hanafuda became a popular gambling game with different card designs in the mid-17th century.

There are many other theories that link it to other games and countries. It is difficult to arrive at a conclusion about the definite origin and history of rummy. Whatever the origin could have been, what makes the game special is that it is widely played all over the world across boundaries and unites people with an array of variations.
